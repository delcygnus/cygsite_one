In this statement, Delcygnus LLC will be referred to as Delcygnus, Rockyt Skull will be referred to as the Game, Amazon Inc will be Amazon and an Amazon Fire tablet will be referred to as a Fire. Also, any device which can run the Game will be included as a Fire.

Delcygnus does not collect your name, email address, credit card number nor phone number. In the course of an Amazon transaction, it will receive your Amazon User ID. Your User ID is not your email address nor your account nick name. It is a computer-generated value which looks similar to this:

userId = l3HL7XppEMhrOGDnur9-ulvqomrSg6qyODKmah76lJU=

The User ID acts to uniquely identify you while providing some anonymity. It cannot be used to sign into your account. The presence or absense of an User ID can reveal whether an user is signed-in to their Amazon account or not.

Amazon handles all the billing actions.

The Game does store transaction receipts with your User ID on the Fire, but they are currently not sent anywhere and are saved only as an archive. They will be deleted if you delete the Game.
